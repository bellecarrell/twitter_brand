			<h2>Description</h2>
			We are studying how tobacco is covered in the news media. Our study requires that we identify and categorize tobacco related news articles according to two orthogonal aspects of tobacco discussed in the article. (1) The tobacco product primarily being discussed in the article, such as cigarettes. (2) The thematic content of the story, such as raising tobacco taxes. &nbsp;

			<h2>Your Task</h2>
			You will be given a single news article. If it is not focused on tobacco, please select so, and you will not be prompted with the following questions. You should read the entire article as needed to answer two questions. <i>(1)</i> Select which of the following tobacco products are the <b>primary</b> subject of the article.

			<ul>
				<li><b>Smokeless tobacco</b> includes three common types: chewing tobacco, dissolvable tobacco, and dipping tobacco. These types are marketed under several product names, such as chew, chaw, dip, iqmik, gutka, naswar, paan, snuff, snus, shammah or toombak.</li>
				<br />
				<li><b>Cigarettes</b> are small cylinders of finely cut tobacco leaves rolled in thin paper for smoking. These products are typically associated with brands, such as basic, Dunhill, Doral, Kool, Marlboro, Newport, Prince, Winston, etc. This does not include &quot;cloved cigarettes.&quot;</li>
				<br />
				<li><b>Cigars, Cigarillos, or Little Cigars</b>. Regular cigars are larger than cigarettes and do not have a filter. Cigarillos or little cigars are similar in size and shape of cigarettes but like cigars are wrapped in a tobacco leaf.</li>
				<br />
				<li><b>Kreteks or Cloved Cigarettes</b> are cigarettes made with a blend of tobacco, clove and other flavors. These will sometimes be called &quot;flavored cigarettes&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;flavoured cigars&quot;) or &quot;clove cigarettes&quot; in the United States but Kreteks in Asia. Popular brands include Apache, Djarum, or Dji Sam Soe 234.</li>
				<br />
				<li><b>Bidis, Beedies, or Bidias</b> are like cigarillos (thin brown products wrapped in leaf) but are wrapped in Tendu or Temburni leafs instead of tobacco leafs. Popular brands are Black Swan, Enigma, Jash, Sutra, and Sumo.</li>
				<br />
				<li><b>Electronic Cigarettes or Cigars</b> are battery-powered devices that contains a cartridge filled with nicotine, flavor and other chemicals that can be smoked (or vaped). Brands are numerous but usually involve terms consistent with &quot;vaping&quot; or &quot;vaper.&quot;</li>
				<br />
				<li><b>Waterpipe tobacco or Hookah</b> is a pipe used to smoke Shisha, a combination of tobacco and fruit that is heated and the smoke is filtrated through water.</li>
				<br />
				<li><b>Other</b></li>
				<br />
				<li><b>No product is the focus</b></li>
			</ul>
